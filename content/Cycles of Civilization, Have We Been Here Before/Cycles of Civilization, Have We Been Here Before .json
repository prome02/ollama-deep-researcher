Join us as we examine archaeological enigmas, ancient texts, and scientific theories that suggest humanity's timeline may be far more complex than we've been taught.",

With each successive age, lifespan and virtue diminish until our current Kali Yuga, where 'only a quarter of morality remains, human goodness nearly disappears, and people live less than a hundred years.' Similarly, Hesiod's ancient Greek works describe five ages from Golden to Iron, each less advanced than the previous.
