Built approximately 4,500 years ago during the Ancient Kingdom period, these pyramids served as tombs for the pharaohs. The Great Pyramid of Khufu stands 146 meters tall, constructed from 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing several tons. To this day, scholars continue to debate how ancient Egyptians built such precise, massive structures without modern technology. In recent years, scientists have employed modern technologies to explore the pyramids, from ground-penetrating radar to thermal imaging, attempting to explore their internal secrets without damaging the original structures. Previously, researchers had discovered hidden chambers within the Great Pyramid, but no discovery had ever approached the scale of the underground structure revealed in March 2025.",

Their research team, leading the 'Khafre Project,' claimed to have found a massive underground structural system beneath the Giza Pyramid complex. The research utilized cutting-edge Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology and Doppler tomographic imaging, using two satellites approximately 676 kilometers above Earth to send radar pulses toward the Pyramid of Khafre and construct three-dimensional models by analyzing signal reflections. According to their report, the research team discovered eight vertical cylindrical structures approximately 640 meters below the pyramids, with each column surrounded by spiraling downward passages. Even more astonishing was that these cylindrical structures connected to deeper underground systems, including complex cubic spaces and passage networks, reaching a total depth of 1.2 kilometers underground and spanning nearly 2 kilometers. Team spokesperson Nicole Cicolo stated that these cylindrical structures were likely entrances to the underground system, with deeper areas possibly containing spatial structures matching the 'Hall of Amenti' from ancient Egyptian legends. Notably, the research team claimed to have found similar structures beneath all three major pyramids, suggesting this might be a unified, extensively planned underground network.",

Unlike traditional ground-penetrating radar, SAR technology utilizes satellites to emit radar waves from different angles and collect reflected signals to construct high-resolution three-dimensional images. What makes this research special is the team's combination with Doppler tomographic imaging, enabling them to analyze subtle signal variations, theoretically penetrating deeper soil layers. The research team claimed that radar signals produce unique reflection characteristics when penetrating soil layers of different densities, allowing them to identify underground spaces. However, this technology also faces significant challenges, such as interference from groundwater and minerals, as well as signal attenuation issues. The research team stated they overcame these difficulties through complex algorithms and signal processing techniques, though this became a core point of later controversy. Professor Biondi explained: 'Our technology combines the penetrating capabilities of radar bands with seismic wave spectral analysis, allowing us to see underground depths never before witnessed.'",

        "en": "This astounding discovery quickly sparked intense debate among global archaeological and geophysical experts. Professor Lawrence Conyers, a radar archaeology expert at the University of Denver, was among the first authorities to raise doubts. He pointed out: 'Currently, the most advanced ground-penetrating radar technology can detect depths of around 100 meters at most under ideal conditions. Claiming to detect underground structures 640 meters deep from satellites completely contradicts principles of physics.' Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass also expressed skepticism, emphasizing: 'Announcing such a significant discovery without on-site excavation evidence is irresponsible.' Critics also noted that the research was published to media without peer review, violating basic scientific research principles. Another controversy centered on the research team linking their discovery to the 'Hall of Amenti' from Egyptian mythology. The Hall of Amenti is described in Egyptian mythology as an underground repository of ancient knowledge, but most archaeologists consider it purely legendary. Dr. Amar Osman, an Egyptology specialist at Cairo University, commented: 'Mixing unverified scientific discoveries with mythological legends misleads public perception of ancient Egyptian civilization.' More confusingly, the Egyptian Antiquities Department stated they had no prior knowledge and had not authorized such research activities at the Giza Pyramids. On social media, many scientists questioned the research team's true motives for announcing this discovery, with some suspecting it might be to secure more research funding or attract media attention.",
        "zh": "這項驚人的發現很快引發了全球考古學界和地球物理學專家的激烈爭論。美國丹佛大學雷達考古專家勞倫斯·科尼爾斯教授是最早提出質疑的權威之一。他指出：「目前最先進的地面穿透雷達技術在理想條件下最多只能探測到100米左右的深度，聲稱能從衛星探測到640米深的地下結構是完全不符合物理學原理的。」埃及考古學家紮希·哈瓦斯也表達了懷疑，他強調：「在沒有實地挖掘證據的情況下宣布如此重大的發現是不負責任的。」批評者還指出，這項研究並未經過同行評審就向媒體發布，違背了科學研究的基本準則。另一個爭議焦點是研究團隊將發現與古埃及神話中的「阿蒙提大廳」聯繫起來。阿蒙提大廳在埃及神話中被描述為藏有古代知識的地下寶庫，但大多數考古學家認為這純屬傳說。開羅大學的埃及學專家阿瑪爾·奧斯曼博士評論道：「將未經證實的科學發現與神話傳說混為一談，會誤導公眾對古埃及文明的認知。」更令人困惑的是，埃及文物部門表示，他們事先並不知情，也未授權在吉薩金字塔進行這類研究活動。在社交媒體上，不少科學家質疑研究團隊發布這一發現的真實動機，有人懷疑這可能是為了爭取更多研究經費或吸引媒體關注。"

        "en": "This controversy has prompted profound reflection on the relationship between scientific discoveries, media reporting, and public perception. In the era of social media and 24-hour news cycles, scientific discoveries are often oversimplified or exaggerated, especially when related to mystique-filled subjects like the Egyptian pyramids. Leslie Zhang, Professor of Science Communication at Harvard University, notes: 'Scientific discoveries require time for verification and peer review, but media and the public typically want immediate, definitive answers. This tension easily leads to misunderstandings.' From a technical perspective, this incident also reflects the balance between traditional methods and high-tech approaches in archaeology. On-site excavation and direct examination remain the gold standard in archaeology, but new technologies do provide ways to explore without damaging original relics. Mary Harding, Professor of Archaeology at University College London, states: 'Remote sensing technologies and geophysical methods are indeed increasingly important in archaeology, but they should complement field investigations, not replace them.' Additionally, this event has sparked contemplation about our understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization. Whether ultimately verified or not, the public's keen interest in potentially massive underground structures beneath the Egyptian pyramids reflects our continued fascination with and reverence for the technological achievements of ancient civilizations. Perhaps it is this unknown and mystery that drives us to continually explore and seek knowledge.",

Professor Malanga also acknowledged the technology's limitations and called for collaboration with Egyptian officials for follow-up field investigations to verify their findings. Ahmed Mohammed, spokesperson for the Egyptian Antiquities Department, stated they are evaluating this research report and considering possible geological exploration plans. 'Any investigation of the Giza site must undergo strict review and close supervision to ensure the safety of the ancient monuments.' Regardless of the final outcome, this incident has already driven discussion and development of archaeological technology. Several experts have called for developing more reliable remote sensing technologies and establishing stricter standards for evaluating such discoveries. The University of Cambridge in the UK is developing an integrated underground detection system combining radar, sound waves, and gravity measurements, hoping to more accurately map the underground areas of archaeological sites. On the other hand, this controversy also highlights the importance of international cooperation. Jason Martin, a geological archaeology specialist at the National Geographic Society, believes: 'Cross-border, interdisciplinary collaborative research will be key to future archaeological exploration. The era of solo efforts is over; major discoveries require collective wisdom and multi-perspective scientific verification.'",
