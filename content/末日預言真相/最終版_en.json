We explore whether human civilization is entering a cycle of cognitive and moral decline, and question whether the age of AI signals a gradual outsourcing of thought itself.",

      "Narration": "Over 2,500 years ago, on the banks of the Ganges in ancient India, the Buddha sat among forest trees, surrounded by disciples whose faces were heavy with concern. He knew his time to enter Nirvana was near. After a long silence, Ananda knelt three times and finally, the Buddha spoke: \"The Dharma will fade; the wicked will be as numerous as the sands of the sea, while the good will be but one or two.\" In that moment, his words became a prophecy—one that seems to echo across time, reaching us today. Was it a foresight of the future, or simply a profound understanding of human cycles? If you've followed our channel, you may remember our video on the mysterious underground structure discovered in 2025. Perhaps, that too was a kind of proof: human civilization has never progressed in a straight line.",
      "speak_instructions": "Affect: Sacred and solemn. Tone: Slow, storytelling with quiet gravity. Emotion: Reverent, reflective. Pronunciation: Emphasize sacred terms like 'fades', 'good', with deliberate breath before quoting the prophecy. Pause: 0.5s after 'echo across time, reaching us today.'",
