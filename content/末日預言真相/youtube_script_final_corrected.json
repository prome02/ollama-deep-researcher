            "Narration": "Over 2,500 years ago, on the banks of the Ganges in ancient India, the Buddha sat among forest trees, surrounded by disciples whose faces were heavy with concern. He knew his time to enter Nirvana was near. After a long silence, Ananda knelt three times and finally, the Buddha spoke: \"The Dharma will fade; the wicked will be as numerous as the sands of the sea, while the good will be but one or two.\" In that moment, his words became a prophecy—one that seems to echo across time, reaching us today. Was it a foresight of the future, or simply a profound understanding of human cycles? If you've followed our channel, you may remember our video on the mysterious underground structure discovered in 2025. Perhaps, that too was a kind of proof: human civilization has never progressed in a straight line.",

Geologists have found evidence that Earth has experienced multiple global cataclysms throughout its history: ice ages, asteroid impacts, supervolcanic eruptions—events so severe they could nearly reset all prior achievements. What's fascinating is that ancient cultures across the world seem to remember these disasters, from the Bible's great flood to Ragnarök, and the Mayan calendar's cycles. These stories from different civilizations suggest a universal understanding of cyclical patterns in nature. So why are they so similar? Could they be a reflection of a larger, natural rhythm that humanity experiences time and again? Does our civilization stand on the brink of a similar transformation? \n",

The first step was the Agricultural Revolution, about 10,000 years ago, when we learned to cultivate crops and domesticate animals. In simple terms: we no longer had to spend our days hunting and gathering just to survive. With a steady food supply, we could begin to ask deeper questions: Who am I? Why is the world the way it is? That gave rise to philosophy and religion. Then came the Industrial Revolution, around 300 years ago. Machines—steam engines, textile looms—freed our hands from physical labor. More time meant more science, more art, and the beginnings of the modern world. Next was the Internet Revolution, a shift that began with my parents’ generation. Back then, learning meant going to libraries or seeking teachers. Now, all it takes is a few taps—knowledge from around the world is at our fingertips. No longer a privilege of the few, this was a second Renaissance. And now, we’re climbing a new step: the Age of AI. But this time, we’re not outsourcing muscle or memory—we’re outsourcing thinking itself. Does that excite you—or make you uneasy? In your view, is AI just a tool… or is it becoming a replacement?",

This shift isn't just about tools—it’s changing how our minds work. Imagine a future where deep thinking is rare, replaced by quick, impulse-based decisions.

Emotional headlines grab our attention faster than rational analysis. Social media algorithms target our emotional triggers, keeping us trapped in echo chambers.

In the Sutra of the Disappearance of the Dharma, he said, 'Men will become lazy and no longer listen to the teachings.' Does that sound familiar? The rise of impatience for complex thought, our craving for quick, easy answers? He also said, 'Temples will be abandoned; none will maintain them.' Could that reflect our retreat from spiritual practices, focusing instead on materialism? He foresaw that 'the wicked will be as numerous as the sand of the sea, while the good will be but one or two.' In a society driven by emotion, has moral judgment become so subjective that shared values are dissolving? It makes you wonder: how did the Buddha foresee all this 2,500 years ago? Perhaps it’s not mystical prophecy—but a profound insight into the evolution of human cognition. If we abandon rational thought and surrender to emotional instinct, does society inevitably unravel?\n",

In the Sutra of the Disappearance of the Dharma, the Buddha says: 'The wise ones—the Bodhisattvas, the Pratyekabuddhas, the Arhats—will be driven away by demons. They will retreat into the mountains and guard their clarity in solitude.' Is this escapism? I don’t think so. Imagine a stormy night and you’re holding a single candle—you find shelter not to hide, but to protect the flame. Sometimes, retreat is resistance. And then comes this verse: 'In darkness, moonlight shall rise, and those destined will meet it and revive the Way.' This imagery stayed with me. Maybe each of us can be that moonlight. Practically speaking? Try limiting your social media time. Develop deep reading habits. Seek out opposing views. Take regular digital fasts.

The emotional mind is the passenger—yelling directions based on how things feel. For a long time, the driver was in control. But today, it seems the passenger is grabbing the wheel more often. Let’s look back at our progress. Agriculture freed us from daily food hunts. Industry freed our hands. The internet freed our memory. Now AI is freeing us from thinking. Each step released a burden, but perhaps also a skill. If this path continues, what are we becoming? In the Sutra of the Disappearance of the Dharma, it is written that when emotion replaces reason, society unravels. Could ancient prophecy be a coded warning about the evolution of cognition?

These seem like opposites, but they point to the same root: the abandonment of thought. But I believe there’s a third path—a conscious coexistence with technology. Let AI be a support, not a substitute. Like a walking stick—it helps you go further, but you’re still walking. This balanced path is harder—but far more meaningful. Think about your daily choices: Do you scroll short videos or read something that challenges your mind? Do you ask AI for answers, or think first and verify later? Do you only see content that matches your views, or seek out opposing voices? These small habits are shaping our collective direction. Which path do you want humanity to take?

Perhaps ancient prophecies aren't mystical glimpses of the future, but insights into human cognition and civilization's cycles. As the Sutra of the Disappearance of the Dharma concludes: 'This scripture is called the Final Discourse. Proclaim it widely, discern it carefully—the merit is immeasurable.'
